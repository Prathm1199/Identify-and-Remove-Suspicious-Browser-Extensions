# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

# Objective
Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions to improve browser security.

# Steps Taken
Opened Firefox extension manager (about:addons).

Reviewed all installed extensions:

FoxyProxy – needed for proxying burp.

Wappalyzer – used for identifying web technologies.

Installed ColorZilla temporarily for testing.

Checked permissions and found it had access to all websites.

Removed ColorZilla using the Firefox extension manager.

Restarted the browser to complete the removal.

# Findings

Always check extension permissions before installing.

Remove unused or suspicious extensions immediately.
